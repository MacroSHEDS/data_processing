installing timescaledb:
    install ppa vsns of postgres and timescale
    use the timescale repo that includes only apache-2 licensed parts

setting up timescaledb:
    ignore next two. just use default postgres superuser.
        see digitalocean bookmark instead of link for setting up postgres superuser
        the superuser should have the same name as an existing linux user, so long as auth is ident based
    connect to console with sudo -u postgres psql; not the 
mike modification
