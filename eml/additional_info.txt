Glossary of Terms (*as used in this documentation)

watershed
    All land area contributing runoff to a point of interest along a stream.
    Does not necessarily account for inputs from subsurface flow or human-constructed diversions.
    We avoid the terms "catchment" and "basin," though they are sometimes used in this way.
site*
    An individual gauging station or stream sampling location and its watershed.
domain*
    One or more sites under common management.
network*
    One or more domains under common funding/leadership.
provider*
    Also sometimes referred to as a "source" -- a primary source of data assimilated into MacroSheds.
    May be a network, domain, or third party.
product*
    A collection of data, possibly including multiple datasets/tables. Providers may separate products by
    temporal extent/interval, scientific category, detection method, and/or sampling location.
prodname
    One of the 7 core product categories included in the MacroSheds dataset. See below.
prodcode
    An alphanumeric string associated with a product. Providers have their own. MacroSheds uses its own scheme internally.
    This won't be relevant for most users, but see detailed documentation included with core data downloads for more information.
site-product, site-year, etc.
    Terms like these are used to designate various subdivisions of the overall MacroSheds dataset.
    A site-product, for example, is the collection of all data for a single MacroSheds product, available at a single site.

MacroSheds data are organized into the following products:

discharge
    Streamflow; water volume over time; reported in L/s.
stream chemistry
    Concentration of chemical constituents in stream water; reported in mg/L or mEq/L.
stream flux
    Mass of chemical constituents in stream water, per watershed area, over time; reported in kg/ha/d.
    (not currently included with this dataset, but can be generated via the macrosheds package for R)
precipitation
    Rainfall, snowfall, or both combined; reported per watershed in mm.
precipitation chemistry
    Concentration of chemical constituents in precipitation; reported in mg/L or mEq/L; averaged across watershed area.
precipitation flux
    Mass of chemical constituents in precipitation, per watershed area, over time; reported in kd/ha/d.
    (not currently included with this dataset, but can be generated via the macrosheds package for R)
watershed attributes
    Areal watershed summary statistics, variables available are common to all MacroSheds sites.
