This repo contains the code used to produce most of the attributes of the **Catchment Attributes and MEteorology for Large-sample Studies** or **CAMELS** data set. These attributes were computed for 671 catchments in the United States and were introduced in the following paper:

*Addor, N., Newman, A. J., Mizukami, N. and Clark, M. P.: The CAMELS data set: catchment attributes and meteorology for large-sample studies, Hydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 21(10), 5293–5313, [doi:10.5194/hess-21-5293-2017](http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/hess-21-5293-2017) , 2017.*

This code was subsequently used to produce a similar data set for Chile including 516 catchments, **CAMELS-CL**:

P., Addor, N., Galleguillos, M., Zambrano-Bigiarini, M., Lara, A., Puelma, C., Cortes, G., Garreaud, R., McPhee, J. and Ayala, A.: The CAMELS-CL dataset: catchment attributes and meteorology for large sample studies – Chile dataset, Hydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 22, 5817–5846, [doi:10.5194/hess-22-5817-2018](http://dx.doi.org/doi:10.5194/hess-22-5817-2018), 2018.*

By using the same code for several data sets, we aim to improve results comparability across countries. This code is open source to improve the transparency and reproducibility of hydrological experiments.
