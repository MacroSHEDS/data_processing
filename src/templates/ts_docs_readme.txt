MacroSheds products are referred to as <product name>__<product code>. product codes are
used internally, and are not attached to our downloadable products, however,
they are included in our documentation to reduce potential ambiguity. Note that
product codes of the format "msXXX", where X is an integer, are reserved for
"derived" products. These products are at the final stage of processing, whereas
"retrieved"/"raw" and "munged" products are precursors to derived products and (where possible)
retain product codes as assigned by their primary data sources. Also note that derived
product codes are only unique within a MacroSheds domain.
