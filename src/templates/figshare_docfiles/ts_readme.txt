By using these data, you acknowledge that you have read the MacroSheds Data Use Agreements,
included with our published documentation at PLACEHOLDER0, and available under the Data tab at macrosheds.org.
Please contact us (mail@macrosheds.org) if you feel these agreements, or any other text included with MacroSheds
documentation and data, should be amended.

To help users meet primary sources' citation and intellectual rights requirements, we have provided two convenient resources.
The first, for users of the macrosheds R package, is the ms_generate_attribution function, which produces a list of acknowledgements, citations, contact emails, and IR notifications based on a given data.frame in MacroSheds format. The second is a document
included with our dataset documentation on Figshare (01b_attribution_and_intellectual_rights_complete.docx)
that contains essentially the output of the ms_generate_attribution function, assuming the entire MacroSheds dataset
is being used. The content of this document can be copied and pasted, in whole or in part, depending on how much
of the overall dataset is actually used.
