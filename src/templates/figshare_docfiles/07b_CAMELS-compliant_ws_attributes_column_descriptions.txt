Deviations from CAMELS:
We used gSSURGO (Soil Survey Staff 2022) instead of the superseded STATSGO dataset for soil characteristics, namely sand_frac, clay_frac, silt_frac, and organic_frac. We have omitted the following variables that are included with the original CAMELS dataset: soil_depth_pelletier, soil_depth_statsgo, soil_porosity, soil_conductivity, max_water_content, water_frac, other_frac. However, note that equivalents of these variables are included with the core MacroSheds watershed attribute dataset.

Two other CAMELS watershed attributes, pet_mean and aridity, were also computed differently for MacroSheds watersheds. For these, we solved the Priestly-Taylor formulation by using a gridded ùõº product (Aschonitis et al. 2017), rather than calibrating ùõº ourselves.
