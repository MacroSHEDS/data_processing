MacroSheds detection limits as reported by primary data sources:
Column names and their descriptions


1. domain

MacroSheds domain code. A domain includes one or more sites under common management.


2. prodcode

MacroSheds product name (e.g. stream_chemistry) and product code (e.g. 208). Product codes are shared with primary source where possible.
Multiple products may be included in this column, separated by a "|" character.

3. variable_converted

Usually the same as variable_original. MacroSheds represents some molecules by their primary atomic constituents, e.g. NH4 as NH4-N.
In these cases we convert the detection limit into terms of the primary constituent via molar mass ratios.

4. variable_original

The variable measured by the primary source.

5. detection_limit_converted

The detection limit as stored by MacroSheds, representing any unit or molecular conversions we've applied.

6. detection_limit_original

The detection limit as reported by the primary source

7. unit_converted

The MacroSheds standard unit into which the detection limit was converted. See 05b_timeseries_variable_metadata.csv for a full list of MacroSheds variables.

8. unit_original

The unit of the detection limit as reported by the primary source

9. start_date

the date as YYYY-MM-DD on which the corresponding detection limit became effective.

10. end_date

the date as YYYY-MM-DD on which the corresponding detection limit no longer applies.
