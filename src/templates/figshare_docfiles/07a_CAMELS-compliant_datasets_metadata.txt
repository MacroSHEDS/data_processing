The subset of MacroSheds that relates to streamflow and climate forcings makes it a valuable supplement to existing datasets like CAMELS (671 sites) and GAGES-II (9067 sites). Using CAMELS methods, we have compiled watershed attributes and Daymet forcings, for each MacroSheds site, that are immediately commensurable with the published CAMELS dataset, enhancing the predictive power of the combined set, especially for small watersheds.

Please note that we used gSSURGO (Soil Survey Staff 2022) instead of the superseded STATSGO dataset for soil characteristics. Two other CAMELS watershed attributes, pet_mean and aridity, were also computed differently for MacroSheds watersheds. For these, we solved the Priestly-Taylor formulation by using a gridded 𝛼 product (Aschonitis et al. 2017), rather than calibrating 𝛼 ourselves.
