The subset of MacroSheds that relates to streamflow and climate forcings makes it a valuable supplement to existing datasets like CAMELS (671 sites) and GAGES-II  (9067 sites). Using CAMELS methods, we have compiled watershed attributes and Daymet forcings, for each MacroSheds site, that are immediately commensurable with the published CAMELS dataset, enhancing the predictive power of the combined set, especially for small watersheds. Of the 178 sites with discharge data that MacroSheds adds to this corpus (as of version 1), 122 have watershed areas of 10 km2 or less, and 68 have areas of 1 km2 or less. For CAMELS, these numbers are 8 and 0, respectively. For GAGES-II, they are 207 and 2 (see Figure 2 in the MacroSheds data paper, in review at the time of this writing).

Please note that we used gSSURGO (Soil Survey Staff 2022) instead of the superseded STATSGO dataset for soil characteristics. Two other CAMELS watershed attributes, pet_mean and aridity, were also computed differently for MacroSheds watersheds. For these, we solved the Priestly-Taylor formulation by using a gridded ùõº product (Aschonitis et al. 2017), rather than calibrating ùõº ourselves.
