Thanks for checking out MacroSheds.

There's a lot of documentation here. We don't expect you to read everything, but PLEASE
carefully consider the data policy. Most of the data included here are (re)distributed
under CC-BY-4.0, so you're free to share and adapt, but a few of our primary sources have more
restrictive rules, and you could get into trouble by using MacroSheds data heedlessly.
See the data policy (01_data_use_policy.txt, alongside this readme) for more information.

Otherwise, just refer to this file, and the many others it describes, as needed. And
don't forget about macrosheds.org for visualizing the MacroSheds dataset, and the "macrosheds"
R package for working with it (https://github.com/MacroSHEDS/macrosheds).
