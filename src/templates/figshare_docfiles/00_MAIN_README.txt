Thanks for checking out MacroSheds.

There's a lot of documentation here. We don't expect you to read everything, but PLEASE
carefully consider the data policy. Most of the data included here are (re)distributed
under CC0 (no rights reserved) or CC-BY-4.0 (attribution required), but a few of our
primary sources have more restrictive rules. See the data policy (01_data_use_policy.txt)
alongside this readme for more information. For citations, licenses, etc., broken down
by domain and product, see 05a_timeseries_LEGAL.csv and 06a_ws_attr_LEGAL.csv.
And please contact us (mail@macrosheds.org) if you feel any MacroSheds content should be amended.

Otherwise, just refer to this file, and the many others it describes, as needed. And
don't forget about macrosheds.org for visualizing the MacroSheds dataset, and the "macrosheds"
R package for working with it (https://github.com/MacroSHEDS/macrosheds).
