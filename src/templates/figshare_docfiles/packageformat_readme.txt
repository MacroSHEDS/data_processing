This dataset is intended to be used through the "macrosheds" package for R
(https://github.com/MacroSHEDS/macrosheds). It is not documented or organized to be
accessed directly by end-users. The official MacroSheds dataset is available on the data portal of
the Environmental Data Initiative (EDI) at https://portal.edirepository.org/nis/mapbrowse?scope=edi&identifier=1262

PLEASE carefully consider the data policy. Most of the data included here are (re)distributed
under CC BY 4.0, so you're free to share and adapt with attribution, but a few of our
primary sources have more restrictive rules, and you could get into trouble by using
MacroSheds data heedlessly. See the data policy (data_use_agreements.docx) on EDI
for more information.
