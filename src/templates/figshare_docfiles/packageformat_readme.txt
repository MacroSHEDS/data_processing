This dataset is intended to be used through the "macrosheds" package for R
(https://github.com/MacroSHEDS/macrosheds). It is not documented or arranged to be
accessed directly by end-users. The official MacroSheds dataset is available on the data portal of
the Environmental Data Initiative (EDI). Publication is currently pending.

PLEASE carefully consider the data policy. Most of the data included here are (re)distributed
under CC BY 4.0, so you're free to share and adapt with attribution, but a few of our
primary sources have more restrictive rules, and you could get into trouble by using
MacroSheds data heedlessly. See the data policy (data_use_agreements.docx, alongside this readme)
for more information.
