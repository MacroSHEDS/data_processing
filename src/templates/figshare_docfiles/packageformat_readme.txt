This dataset is intended to be used through the "macrosheds" package for R
(https://github.com/MacroSHEDS/macrosheds). It is not documented or arranged to be
accessed directly by end-users, but you're welcome to use it to download data one
MacroSheds domain at a time. The official MacroSheds dataset is available at https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.c.5621740.

PLEASE carefully consider the data policy. Most of the data included here are (re)distributed
under CC BY 4.0, so you're free to share and adapt with attribution, but a few of our
primary sources have more restrictive rules, and you could get into trouble by using
MacroSheds data heedlessly. See the data policy (data_use_agreements.docx, alongside this readme)
for more information.
