MacroSheds CAMELS-compliant Daymet climate forcings

The Daymet forcings accompanying the core MacroSheds dataset represent watershed averages of published, gridded Daymet products (Thornton et al. 2020). Note that our format is a little different from what CAMELS provides. Our Daymet files are CSVs with a single datetime column and only one header. For site locations and elevations (and lots of other site information) see 04_site_documentation.

We've included timeseries of potential evapotranspiration (pet) in this dataset, though pet is not a Daymet variable per se. The pet product was also computed differently for MacroSheds watersheds than for CAMELS in that we solved the Priestly-Taylor formulation by using a gridded ùõº product (Aschonitis et al. 2017), rather than calibrating ùõº ourselves.
