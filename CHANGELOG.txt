for v2:
for watersheds smaller than 10 ha, GEE reducers sometimes fail to produce a value. these watershed boundary features have been replaced with a 10 ha circle for the purposes of GEE reductions, resulting in cc_precip, cc_temp, and aet values where previously they were missing for calhoun weir_4, baltimore MCDN, etc. as a byproduct, other watershed summary values for these sites may have changed slightly from version 1

previously, if there were duplicate datetime-site_code pairs in a raw data file, we would keep the row with the fewest missing values. now we take the mean across each variable, omitting NAs.

fixed a QC-code assimilation bug that was allowing a small number of bad data values into the final product. These may have appeared as outliers in v1. 
 
dates irrelevant...
neon reports BDL and ND. BDL gets a flag. ND is replaced with DL/2

	fixed ms_cast_and_reflag, resulting in some recoveries:
	to report: bonanza timezone error (was local, now utc)
	hjandrews [6825 clean records recovered for precip (3%)]
	mcmurdo [changelog: too many dirties in stream chem (26% -> 23%)]

NEON added
	where domain lab and external lab data both present, these are averaged
		e.g. swc_domainLabData and swc_externalLabDataByAnalyte for stream chemistry 20093
	for domain lab data, 
		ms_status = 1 given if remarks present and not related to replicate|SOP|protocol|cartridge
			probs find some examples of these
	for external lab data
		shipmentWarmQF =  ms_status 1
		prioritize sampleCondition == GOOD, else take OK, else settle for Other
	composite discharge now included. all simulated values marked by ms_status = 1 and ms_interp = 1. all original NEON values are 0. if kept, assumed clean
		
	ignoring upstream sensor array (S1) readings UNLESS value missing from S2. S2 collects all the same stuff and then some. S1 does water qual, temp, PAR, cond. PAR is not borrowed from upstream if downsteram missing
