all data downloaded from MacroSheds MUST be cited in any reuse. this refers to the
MacroSheds project citation as well as citations for all original data source
publications. 

all data sources have different citation requirements. Critical 
metadata to help users meet these requirements is provided here, in this
README.txt file and the accompanying CSV, of format {domain_name}.csv

the data in this CSV is organized in 7 columns: 

DOI (Document Object Identifier), license, license_type, license_stipulations, 
data_status, citation. 

all users must read domain metadata in entirety. DOI and citation are included
for ease of use and citation. license information and data status is important 
legal and logistical information- including that some sites REQUIRE direct 
contact and individual permission for reuse.
