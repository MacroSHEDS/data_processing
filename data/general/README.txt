as of 10/27/2020 we are no longer storing config datasets (site_data, variables, etc) as local CSVs, but as google sheets. this way, changes made are immediately accessible to all developers. the old CSVs are stored in data/general/obsolete, and will eventually be deleted. these local CSVs (and the data/general storage location) will still be relevant for eventual users of macrosheds, who will be able to elect whether they want to store config data locally or on gsheets
