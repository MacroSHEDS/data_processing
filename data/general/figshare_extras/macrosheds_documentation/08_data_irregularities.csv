neon,neon,all,whole_record,NA,discharge,IS_discharge,All discharge from NEON is currently provisional. Data contain significant gaps and large spikes. Use with caution.,FALSE
neon,neon,all,whole_record,NA,stream_chemistry,all,NEON stream chemistry is provisional and likely to change. Analytical procedures are being updated.,FALSE
lter,luquillo,all,1983-01-01,1994-01-01,stream_chemistry,"GN_NO3_N,GN_NH4_N",Water samples for this duration were treated differently than for the rest of the record. Samples were frozen and NH4 was preserved with H2SO4. Analyzed off-site.,TRUE
lter,luquillo,QP,whole_record,NA,discharge,IS_discharge,Rating curves were changed on 2013-03-26. Values appear to be very large after this change.,FALSE
lter,santa_barbara,all,whole_record,NA,discharge,IS_discharge,Discharge is calculated based on pressure transducers and USGS HEC-RAS model. This appears to result in inaccurate high flows.,TRUE
czo,boulder,"GGU,GGL",whole_record,NA,discharge,IS_discharge,"Both GGL and GGU discharge are provisional at this point. In addition, GGL (lower site on the same stream as GGU) appears to have higher discharge values than GGU. Use with caution.",TRUE

lter,arctic,"Kuparuk_River,Oksrukuyik_Creek",whole_record,NA,discharge,IS_discharge,"Discharge on both streams is only measured at one location. For flux estimates, discharge may be associated with a chemistry sampling point that is up to 4 km away from the discharge station.",TRUE
lter,arctic,all,whole_record,NA,discharge,IS_discharge,Discharge is only measured seasonally from May to September,TRUE
lter,niwot,all,whole_record,NA,discharge,IS_discharge,Discharge is only measured seasonally from May to September. It appears stream gauges are not always active during the beginning of snow melt.,TRUE
